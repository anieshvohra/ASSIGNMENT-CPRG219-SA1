Hey there! I wanted to take a moment to share my experience creating my HTML website and using version control—it was quite the journey! <br>
#What Went Well:<br> 
First off, I’m really proud of how my design turned out. Working with HTML and CSS was a lot of fun, and watching everything come together visually felt amazing. When I finally saw my website looking the way I imagined, it was such a great feeling! Plus, using Git for version control really saved me a lot of headaches. It was comforting to know I could easily track my changes and revert to earlier versions if something went wrong.

<br> #What I Learned About HTML: <br/>
I learned a ton about HTML through this project. I discovered how important it is to use semantic tags properly, which really helps with accessibility. It made me realize how much of a difference it can make for users, and I’m glad I could create something that’s easier for everyone to navigate.
<br> #What Was Tricky: <br/>
Now, on to the tricky parts! One of the biggest challenges was getting all the pieces—HTML, CSS, and JavaScript—to work together smoothly. I spent a lot of time testing my site in different browsers to make sure it looked consistent everywhere. It was frustrating at times, especially when I found that a small change in one file could mess things up in another. Staying organized with my code became super important.
What Was Particularly Challenging 
<br>
The biggest hurdle for me was definitely wrapping my head around version control. At first, Git felt overwhelming—I struggled with the commands and the whole concept of branching. But as I kept practicing, things started to click. It was a challenge, but I realized how invaluable it is for managing projects and collaborating with others.
<br> #Conclusion: <br/>
In the end, this experience really taught me a lot about web development and the power of version control. I feel more confident in my skills now, and I’ve learned how to approach problems with a clearer mindset. It wasn’t just about coding; it was about growing and learning to adapt. Thanks for listening,
